# Canvas LMS Icons

This repository provides a comprehensive reference for **Canvas LMS built-in icons**. It demonstrates how to use Canvas icons effectively in course sites, with examples for adding icons to headings, buttons, and other elements. The main HTML file, `Canvas-LMS-Icons.html`, serves as a guide for utilizing these icons within an LMS environment.

## Features

- **Extensive Icon List**: A table featuring various Canvas LMS icons, including each iconâ€™s name and corresponding HTML code.
- **Accessibility Focus**: Guidance on using `aria-hidden`, `role="img"`, and other attributes to ensure icons are accessible and screen-reader-friendly.
- **Integration Examples**: Demonstrations of how to incorporate icons into Canvas course elements like headings and buttons.

## Getting Started

1. **Download the HTML File**:
    - Download `Canvas-LMS-Icons.html` from this repository to view and interact with the full icon list.
2. Copy the HTML code into your Canvas LMS course site using the editor.
3. Save and review the page to ensure the icons display correctly and are accessible.

## Usage

### Adding Icons
1. **Using the `<i>` Element**:
    - Each Canvas icon is represented by an `<i>` element with specific classes, such as:
      ```html
      <i class="icon-announcement" aria-hidden="true"></i>
      ```
2. **Integrating Icons into Buttons**:
    - For better styling and functionality, wrap icons within clickable elements. For example:
      ```html
      <button class="btn btn-primary">
          <i class="icon-like" aria-hidden="true"></i> Like
      </button>
      ```

### Accessibility Considerations
- **aria-hidden**: Add `aria-hidden="true"` to decorative icons to hide them from screen readers.
- **role="img"**: Use `role="img"` and `aria-label` for icons that convey specific meaning or functionality.
